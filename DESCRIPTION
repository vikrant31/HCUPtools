Description: A comprehensive R package for accessing and working with publicly 
    available and free resources from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
    (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The package provides 
    streamlined access to HCUP's Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) 
    mapping files and Summary Trend Tables, enabling researchers and analysts to 
    efficiently map ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes and ICD-10-PCS procedure codes to 
    CCSR categories and access HCUP statistical reports. Key features include: 
    direct download from HCUP website, multiple output formats (long/wide/default), 
    cross-classification support, version management, citation generation, and 
    intelligent caching. The package does not redistribute HCUP data files but 
    facilitates direct download from the official HCUP website, ensuring users 
    always have access to the latest versions and maintain compliance with HCUP 
    data use policies. This package only accesses free public tools and reports; 
    it does NOT access HCUP databases (NIS, KID, SID, NEDS, etc.) that require 
    purchase. For more information, see <https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/>.
